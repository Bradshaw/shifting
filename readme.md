# Shifting

A roguelike game I'm writing for fun.

More or less set in the same "universe" as [Burden](https://spaceshipsin.space/burden), a TTRPG I'm designing.

## Goals

### Technical

- Learn how to program in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- Play with some fun procedural generation algorithms

### Game design

Most of the design ideas align with the [Burden Design Guide](https://spaceshipsin.space/burden/design-guide)

- Focus on exploration
- Deemphasize/discourage combat

## Building and running the game

- Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- Run `cargo run` in the root folder of this repository
